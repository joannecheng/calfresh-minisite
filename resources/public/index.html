              People who have never been on food stamps and who don’t think they
              know anyone who has relied upon them think that food stamps are
              for people who are different from them. Food stamps are a way of
              coping with a challenge that almost everyone is familiar with:
              making ends meet. In fact, the most common dilemma GetCalFresh
              applicants mention in their applications is not being able to
              afford food after paying for rent, utilities, and gas or fare to
              get to work.

            <p>
              Outside observers often try to place the blame on food stamps
              recipients for their situation. Yet, the most common challenge that
              our applicants face is one that anyone living in California knows
              well. California’s high cost of living is a systemic problem that
              leaves most residents more vulnerable if they unexpectedly lose
              income or have an increase in expenses.
            </p>

            <p>
              Put simply, Californians live in circumstances that make it very
              likely many people will need to apply for food stamps to make it
              through unexpected challenges. In fact, the most common sentiment
              expressed in our applications is the difficulty of making ends,
              particularly after an experiencing an adverse event. While some
              applicants recognize that their situation is largely a product of
              the high cost of living in California and bad luck, many tell us
              that thepoy delayed seeking food stamps because of stigma.
            </p>

            <p>
              California has a very high cost of living that can make it difficult
              for families to make ends meet. Even with a full-time job, many
              Californians struggle to cover all their basic needs. In fact, in
              some California counties, the median income is lower than the cost
              of living (see below).

              students, elderly, people who are between work or who can’t work.
