            People who have never been on food stamps and who don’t think they
            know anyone who has relied upon them think that food stamps are for
            people who are different from them.
            Food stamps are a way of coping with a challenge that almost
            everyone is familiar with: making ends meet.
            In fact, the most common dilemma GetCalFresh applicants mention in
            their applications is not being able to afford food after paying for
            rent, utilities, and gas or fare to get to work.

        <h3>Cost of Living</h3>

          <div class="grid-item width-two-thirds">

          <p>
            Outside observers often try to place the blame on food stamps
            recipients for their situation. Yet, the most common challenge that
            our applicants face is one that anyone living in California knows
            well. California’s high cost of living is a systemic problem that
            leaves most residents more vulnerable if they unexpectedly lose
            income or have an increase in expenses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Put simply, Californians live in circumstances that make it very
            likely many people will need to apply for food stamps to make it
            through unexpected challenges. In fact, the most common sentiment
            expressed in our applications is the difficulty of making ends,
            particularly after an experiencing an adverse event. While some
            applicants recognize that their situation is largely a product of
            the high cost of living in California and bad luck, many tell us
            that thepoy delayed seeking food stamps because of stigma.
          </p>

          <p>
            California has a very high cost of living that can make it difficult
            for families to make ends meet. Even with a full-time job, many
            Californians struggle to cover all their basic needs. In fact, in
            some California counties, the median income is lower than the cost
            of living (see below).

            [area. kept to preserve comments]. Give one or two of the extreme
            examples of counties where costs are greater income with some
            numbers. Give one or two examples of counties where cost less than
            income, but talk about how the median income doesn’t extend to
            students, elderly, people who are between work or who can’t work.
