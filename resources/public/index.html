              Who actually receives food stamps?
            </h1>

            <h2>
              A FRESH look at the facts.
            </h3>

            <p>
              The stigma placed on recipients of food stamps — that they just
              don’t want to work, that they are exploiting the system — is not
              only misguided, it’s incorrect. More importantly, this stigma
              prevents or delays people from seeking help that they need. People
              of all backgrounds receive food stamps, but the vast majority of
              them were already struggling to make ends meet when they were hit
              with an a job loss or reduction in hours, or an unexpected
              expense, often due to illness or disability. We’ve taken a deep
              dive into our applicant data, and have gathered their stories to
              provide a more accurate picture of who receives food assistance in
              America.

              People who have never been on food stamps often think that they
              are for people who are somehow different from them. In fact, food
              stamps are a way of coping with a challenge that almost everyone
              is familiar with: making ends meet. The most common dilemma
              GetCalFresh applicants mention in their applications is not being
              able to afford food after paying for rent, utilities, and gas or
              fare to get to work.

              Outside observers often try to place the blame on food stamps
              recipients for their situation. Yet, the most common challenge
              that our applicants face is one that Californians knows well.
              California’s high cost of living is a systemic problem that leaves
              most residents more vulnerable if they unexpectedly lose income or
              have an increase in expenses. The figure below shows the
              difference between the money required to pay for essentials in
              each California county and the median income in those counties.

              This data tell a story of stress: the typical household in several
              counties is already struggling to make ends meet. These households
              have no slack in their incomes - they already cannot keep up with
              the bare necessities. Figure X shows how costs of living typically
              break out by county.

              A single car accident, medical emergency, or unexpected layoff can put

              something as essential as food, housing, or medical care.

              Many CalFresh applicants are facing unemployment. Having food costs
              covered helps them focus on finding new work without worrying about
