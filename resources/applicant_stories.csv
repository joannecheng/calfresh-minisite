  We just moved up from San Diego because we had lost our jobs down South. We moved back to El Dorado County because that is where our family lives AND its cheaper.
 
  We have both been applying to the hospitals around the area as well as contruction myself. I have been on multiple interviews and unfortunetly they picked other people for the positions.
 
  We are looking for some help with food during this rough patch until I am able to find a fulltime position to bring in money. Between our rent and bills we have very little left for food afterwards.
 
  Last year we cashed out all our retirement to get us moved back to Northern California. We did live with family for 3 months. Then we were able to find a house with low rent. However now our funds are getting low again and we are running out of options. We pray that a job will come up soon.
 
 
  My wife works for 2 companies on contracts. So income varies monthly.
 
 
  I am eager to talk with you about this and we can provide anything that you guys need.

  If i only had enough to eat, I beleive I can muster the brain power to get out of this viscous cycle of modern slavery. I have been the driving force behind companies being bought for millions trhese last few years and I am serving billionares in the summer at the bohemian grove while sleeping in a corolla. If it werent for my bosses, i would have never found a room for rent that was less than $1000 a month with kithchen access. After rent and other bills, I have $12 left over which i feed to my car in the form of gasoline. I eat nutrigrain bars from the work pantry as my main caloric intake in the mornings. and have been cooking lentils and rice for most of my meals at home. 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  Sometimes when I'm bored, I'll do the math to figure out how I can spend $3 on food that day instead of the usual $2 budget I give myself. I'm 6'5'' and am dropping weight and starting to lose my cognitive functions. Please let me partake in this help temporarily. All I know right now is that I need to eat, then I can figure out the rest. My parents are in no position to help financially as one is on disability in modesto worst off than me, and the other just texted me that he's been worrking 30 days straight in the sun doing construction. He's 60. I am 28, hoping to have enough to eat by my birthday coming up on the 12th of September.

I found out last year after multiple visits to the financial aid office that for the rest of my education that I will not be getting almost any financial aid. It was for the reason that my parents just barely made the line of which to receive financial aid and so I ended up getting 745$ (in grants) this year instead of the 12,000$ (in grants) (estimation) from last year. My dad works as a construction worker and its only on certain weeks that he gets paid good which ends up making it like we have money but in reality, the pay is inconsistent to what he regular earns and is more of a random chance thing. Anyways seeing this my parents and friends have considered having me drop out but I really did not want to give up on college. I worked over the summer to afford the first couple of months for rent, I used all my Chico State loan offers for the year for tuition and so I have 7 months of rent to pay and any other expenses that would arise. (Food, school supplies, books, etc). Beacuse of this my parents have also taken out loans to pay for the rent (which was a horrible idea as it would just lead to more debt but he insisted as he did not in any way want me to struggle as my parents and I live about 8 hours from each other.) so my rent is covered. But now I do not have any money at all for the other expenses. I plan on getting a job or two and plan to work all year to not only cover these other expenses but to if anything help lower the huge debt I have obtained.

I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t intend to take advantage of CalFresh services for a over extended period, Only until I find a job that can allow me flexible hours while my grandma needs my continued support. Thank you for taking the time to read about my current situation.","I'm 25 and I take care of my grandma who has been on dialysis for the past 11 years. I offer my daily help for free and I have done this for several years however, it has become increasingly hard to support myself with very little money and hardly any family support. I go to local churches and food drives and get food for my grandpa, grandma and myself. Unfortunately, I find that many days and nights I go hungry. I am extremely independent - seeking help for others is easy, but for myself I have trouble accepting anything I don't feel I earned, but everyone needs a little help to get on their feet sometimes.

356027,"I suffer from a movement disorder akin to Parkinson's, and it's thought to be myoclonus, or myoclonus dystonia. I can't work as of now, and I am going through further tests to get a precise diagnosis, but it's a lengthy process thus far. I am paying rent with my state disability, as social security has rejected my application for disability. This leaves me with about $20 for the month. This means gas for school and food for myself. I cannot make $20 stretch that far, as much as I would like to. I'm currently appealing the denial, but this process takes time, and I don't have resources to survive, much less the physical capability a lot of the time. Please help. Thank you.","I suffer from a movement disorder akin to Parkinson's, and it's thought to be myoclonus, or myoclonus dystonia.
